# lessons_and_exercises

## Proposal

The ideia behind this repository is to archive information about lessons and exercises from courses. Although it's important to clarify that its content is a representation of my understanding of the courses proposal.
Also you may find here attempts of solution of a series of challenges propositions from sites such as:
```
- [HackerRank] (https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codewars] (https://www.codewars.com)
- [LeetCode] (https://leetcode.com/)
- [Beecrowd] (https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/login/?origem=1)
```
