    <title>CSS Sass Init</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- We can generate a npm package.json by entering the command <npm init -y> -->
    <!-- The <-y> installs the deafult configuration so we don`t have to answer setup questions -->

    <!-- The command <npm install node-sass> will install node sass pre compiler -->

    <!-- Once installed it will generate a node modules directory along with a package-lock.json file -->

    <!-- The next step is to replace on package.json line 7(seven) by the following command line -->
    <!-- "sass": "node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css/ --recursive" -->

    <!-- The Sass script will allow us to use the command npm run sass -->

    <!-- The line basic dictates that we are running node-sass -->
    <!-- The -w is a watch flag to constantly watch our folder scss/ -->
    <!-- The -o is an output which will point to a folder called dist/css/ -->
    <!-- Ending up with --recursive -->

    <!-- We use .scss because of its syntax which is close to CSS -->

    <!-- After that we create on our directory root two folders one called scss and other called dist -->
    <!-- Inside the scss we create a main.scss file -->
    <!-- Now we execute the command: <npm run sass> -->

    <!-- After that we put a small code line inside the file main.scss and save it -->
    <!-- Once saved it will complete rendering and creating inside our dist folder a css folder -->
