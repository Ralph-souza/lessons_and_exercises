    <!-- Tailwind is a CSS framework that uses low-level "utility" classes to create layouts -->
    <!-- It is a "utility first" framework -->
    <!-- Tailwind uses classes as utilities to put together to build your own custom components -->

    <!-- Frameworks such as bootstrap use classes correlated to components (Alerts, Navbars) -->
